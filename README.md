Tech Stack
Here is a possible (or assumed) tech stack. (Modify as per your actual implementation.)

Frontend: React / Vue / Angular (or server-rendered templates)

Backend: Node.js / Django / Laravel / etc.

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB

Authentication / Authorization: JWT / OAuth / session-based

Video / Streaming: WebRTC / Zoom API / third-party integration

Hosting / Infrastructure: AWS / Azure / GCP / DigitalOcean

CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Travis CI, Jenkins, etc.

Others: Email service (SendGrid, Mailgun), Payment gateway integration, Logging, etc.

Architecture
Here‚Äôs a simplified view of how components might be organized:

[User / Browser]  
   ‚Üì  
[Frontend App] ‚Üê‚Üí [Backend API & Web Server]  
   ‚Üì  
[Database]  
   ‚Üì  
[Third-party services: Video, Email, Payment]  
Users interact via frontend, which talks to backend API.

Backend manages business logic (course enrollment, authentication).

Streaming / video is handled via an external service or internal module.

Admin interface to manage courses, instructors, etc.

Logging, monitoring, and analytics to track usage and performance.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+), npm / yarn

(Or your backend‚Äôs runtime environment)

Database server (PostgreSQL / MySQL / etc.)

API keys / secrets for video, email, payments

Installation Steps
Clone Repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/centuera.git
cd centuera
Setup environment variables
Create a .env (or config) file including variables like:

DB_HOST=
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
JWT_SECRET=
VIDEO_API_KEY=
EMAIL_SERVICE_KEY=
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_KEY=
Install dependencies

npm install
cd backend && npm install   # if separate backend folder
Run database migrations / seed data

npm run migrate
npm run seed
Start development server

npm run dev
Open the app at http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port).

Deployment
Here‚Äôs a sample outline of a deployment process:

Build frontend assets (npm run build)

Deploy backend and connect to production database

Configure environment variables / secrets

Use a process manager (PM2, Docker, Kubernetes)

Set up SSL / HTTPS

Configure domain, DNS, and optionally CDN for static content

Setup monitoring, logging, backups

You can set up automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions or other pipelines.

Usage
