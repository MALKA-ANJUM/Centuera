            information confidential. Our Confidential Information includes, without limitation and
            regardless of whether designated “proprietary” or “confidential”, source code, trade
            secrets and know-how embodied in the Courseware and Site, any results of benchmark tests
            run on the Courseware or Site, any access codes, Intellectual Property, pricing
            information and proposals. The Party receiving Confidential Information (“Receiving

            Information of the Party that has disclosed Confidential Information (“Disclosing
            Party”) that it exercises with its own Confidential Information but no less than a
            reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party may not directly or indirectly disclose,
            copy, distribute, republish, sell, license or otherwise allow any third-Party access to
            such Confidential Information. The Parties agree to maintain the confidentiality as

            Notwithstanding the above, either party may disclose Confidential Information: (1) to
            its employees, contractors or agents who have a need to know in order to provide and
            improve the Courseware and are subject to substantially similar obligations of
            confidentiality; and (2) if required by law (including a court order or subpoena),
            provided, the Receiving Party, where lawfully permitted, promptly notifies the
            Disclosing Party in time to review and challenge the potential disclosure. In the event
            of these Business Terms cease to apply, each Party will either return or, at the
            Disclosing Party’s request, destroy the Confidential Information of the other Party;
            provided however, that we may retain copies of your Confidential Information for routine
            backup and archival purposes.</p>
