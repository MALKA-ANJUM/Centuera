            a business has broken the California Consumer Protection Act. If you decide to lodge a

            this one if you're in the European Union). Note that doing this does not prevent you
            from receiving advertisements. Generic advertisements will still be sent to you.</p>

        <h4>Analytics & Web-beacons</h4>
        <p>For analytics, we make use of third-party technologies. Our analytics provider will get
            all metrics data gathered from your use of the service(s). After then, we utilize this
            data to analyze user behavior on our website and provide statistical reports about user
            activity on our behalf. We could further track or gather your Personally Identifiable
            Information (PII) using the same statistical analytics technology. We shall make use of
            this data to improve, expand, or maintain the operation of the service(s) and to give
            you a more tailored experience. We reserve the right to make aggregated data and
            analysis publicly available as we see fit. Technologies like web beacons are used by us
            and our third-party advertising partners for trend analysis, website administration,
            user movement monitoring, and demographic data collection about our user base as a
            whole. We could get information on how these businesses are using these technologies,
            both individually and together.</p>

        <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
        <p>Currently, a number of browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, have a
            "do not track" or "DNT" option. This option is based on a mechanism called a DNT header,
            which notifies websites that the user has visited about their browser's DNT preference
            setting. Because no industry standard for DNT has been accepted by technology firms,
            trade associations, or regulators—including no uniform standard for understanding user
            intent—we do not yet commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with regard to the
            Company's websites. We will keep an eye on advancements concerning DNT browser
            technology and the establishment of a standard since we value privacy and meaningful
            choice.</p>

        <h4>Links to Third Party Sites</h4>
        <p>Links to external websites that are not under our ownership or control can be found on
            our webpages. Please be advised that we have no control over the privacy policies of
            third parties or such other websites. We urge you to read the privacy policies of any
            website that gathers personal data and to exercise caution while leaving our websites.

            personal information you voluntarily provide in such a forum might be viewed, gathered,
            or utilized by other forum users, who might then use it to contact you with unwanted
            communications. The personal information you decide to provide in these forums is not
            our responsibility. Keep in mind that material you publish publicly might be indexed by
            search engines.</p>

        <p>Social media elements on our websites include interactive mini-programs, the Facebook

            may gather information about the page you are viewing on our websites, your IP address,
            and if a cookie is set to make the feature work. Either a third party hosts social media
            features and widgets, or our websites host them directly. The privacy policy of the firm
            offering these features governs your interactions with them. You may use LinkedIn's
            sign-in services to access our websites. Your identification will be verified by the
